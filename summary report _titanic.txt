Summary of Relationships to Look For:

Feature	        Likely Relationship to Survival	      Why?
sex	            Strong positive for female	      "Women and children first" policy
pclass	        Positive for 1st class	           Higher priority during evacuation
age	            Non-linear (children saved)	       Young passengers may be prioritized
fare        	Slight positive	                   Higher fare → better cabins → more access
sibsp / parch	Moderate (family connections)	   Families may stick together or get help


SUMMARY OF TITANIC DATASET EDA FINDINGS
1.Survival Rate
Only 38% of passengers survived the Titanic disaster.
The majority (~62%) did not survive.

2.  Gender vs Survival

   a) Females had a much higher survival rate than males.

   b) This supports the historical “women and children first” evacuation policy.

3.  Passenger Class (Pclass)

   a) Passengers in 1st class had a significantly higher chance of survival.

   b)Survival rates decreased with class: 1st > 2nd > 3rd.
     Most passengers were in 3rd class, and they had the lowest survival rate.

4.  Age Distribution

   a)Passengers were mostly young adults, with a median age around 28.

   b)Children had higher survival chances, while older adults were less likely to survive.

   c)Age did not have a strong linear correlation with survival but showed trends.

5.  Fare

   a)There was a positive trend between higher fares and survival.

   b)Survivors, on average, paid higher fares — indicating possible better cabins or priority access.

6.  Family Onboard (SibSp & Parch)

   a)Most passengers traveled alone.

   b)Having family members may have slightly helped survival, but it’s not a strong factor.

7.  Correlation Heatmap

   a)fare and pclass showed some correlation with survival.

   b)sex was a very strong indicator (when encoded numerically).

   c)No extreme multicollinearity between numeric features, so each adds some unique information.

Key Insights:
    Being female, in first class, and paying a higher fare significantly increased your chances of survival.

    Being male, young adult, in third class, and traveling alone were associated with lower survival.
